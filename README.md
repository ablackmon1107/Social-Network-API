# Social-Network-API

### Description
This application was built for a social media startup that wants an API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data, Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM, and the moment package to format time stamps.

The user is able to enter a command to start the application and thus sync the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database. When the user opens a API GET routes for users and thoughts then the database for these routes are displayed in JSON Format. Also, the user is able to create, update, and delete users and thoughts in their database as well as create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
